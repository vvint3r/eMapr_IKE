Below is a large, structured “question bank” you can use when designing hierarchical professional roadmaps. Each section corresponds to a design task like the examples you gave.

***

## A. Defining core competencies (top level)

- What problem does this profession primarily exist to solve for its stakeholders?[1]
- Which capabilities must every practitioner have, regardless of role or seniority?[2]
- Which 6–10 competencies are truly core (used daily and critical to performance) vs nice-to-have?[2][1]
- How do we categorize competencies into functional/technical, behavioral, and leadership clusters?[1]
- Which competencies directly support the organization’s strategic goals or mission?[3][1]
- Which competencies are shared across roles and which are role-specific or specialty-specific?[2]
- What does “success” look like when all core competencies are strong in a given role?[4]
- Where do ethics, professionalism, and continuous learning sit in the competency structure?[1][2]
- Which external standards, bodies, or frameworks should inform our competency list?[5]
- How many competencies can we include before the model becomes too complex to use?[2]

***

## B. Breaking the profession into progressive tiers

- What are the distinct career stages in this profession (e.g., novice, practitioner, expert, leader)?[1]
- At each stage, what work should people be trusted to perform without supervision?[5]
- How do responsibilities, autonomy, and decision rights expand from one tier to the next?[2][1]
- Which competencies are expected at all tiers, and which only appear at higher tiers?[2]
- What changes in scope (project size, complexity, impact) distinguish tiers from each other?[5]
- Which behaviors clearly signal that someone has moved from Tier N to Tier N+1?[6][5]
- Which skills must be fully solid before adding higher-level ones (prerequisites)?[5]
- How do we keep the number of tiers manageable while still capturing meaningful progression?[5]
- How long is a realistic time-in-tier for typical performers vs fast-track performers?[7]
- Where do we expect lateral specialization vs vertical progression in this profession?[8]

***

## C. Questions for hierarchical roadmaps in a specific role (e.g., analytics PM)

- What are the main domains of this role (e.g., product discovery, analytics strategy, stakeholder management, delivery)?[9]
- For each domain, what does good performance look like at junior, mid, senior, and lead levels?[5][2]
- What are archetypal projects a junior could own end-to-end vs those reserved for seniors?[9]
- Which skills differentiate a strong specialist from someone ready for cross-functional leadership?[10][11]
- What quarterly or annual learning goals make sense for this role (e.g., by Q2, can run X independently)?[9]
- How should we sequence focus areas over time (e.g., strategy first, then leadership)?[9]
- Which external benchmarks (industry job descriptions, certifications) can we mine for expectations?[1][2]
- What does a realistic 12–18 month roadmap of learning themes for this role look like?[9]
- How should this roadmap integrate with adjacent roles (e.g., data science, engineering, design)?[2]
- Which learning measures (courses, projects, mentoring) will best support this role’s growth?[12][9]

***

## D. Mapping learning outcomes to proficiency levels

- For each competency, what can a learner *do in real work* at each level (not just what they “know”)?[5]
- How do we phrase learning outcomes as observable behaviors (“can independently…”, “can consistently…”) at each level?[6][5]
- Which tasks represent benchmark, milestone, and capstone performance for the competency?[5]
- At what point in a program or career should each outcome reasonably be met?[5]
- How do course/program outcomes line up with institutional or organizational outcomes?[13][5]
- Which outcomes are best assessed via authentic performance (projects, simulations) vs tests?[13]
- How do we ensure each ascending level adds complexity, independence, or impact, not just more of the same?[5]
- Which outcomes indicate readiness to transition from education/training into professional practice?[5]
- How do we handle outcomes that cut across multiple competencies (e.g., collaboration)?[13][2]
- How will we document and communicate the proficiency scale to learners and managers?[5]

***

## E. Designing milestone‑based assessments for each tier

- What are the key milestones that prove someone is ready to move from one tier to the next?[5]
- For each milestone, what authentic task or artifact can demonstrate proficiency (project, portfolio piece, presentation)?[13][5]
- Which criteria should appear in the rubric for each milestone, and what does “meets” vs “exceeds” look like?[6][5]
- How will we gather evidence: self-reports, manager ratings, peer reviews, client feedback, or exam results?[13]
- How often should milestone assessments occur (time-based, event-based, or readiness-based)?[14][13]
- How do we ensure assessments are fair, reliable, and consistent across assessors and teams?[5]
- How will assessment results feed back into updated learning goals and next steps?[14][5]
- Which low-stakes formative checks precede high-stakes milestone assessments?[13]
- How do we accommodate different learning preferences or paths while keeping milestones comparable?[15][13]
- What communication and recognition will accompany milestone completion (badges, promotions, titles)?[16][1]

***

## F. Strategy, stakeholders, and context questions

- Why are we building this roadmap now, and what decisions should it inform (hiring, promotion, training)?[3]
- Who are the primary users of the roadmap (individuals, managers, L&D, HR, educators)?[1][2]
- Which stakeholders must help define competencies and tiers to ensure relevance and buy‑in?[4][1]
- What constraints (budget, time, tools, culture) shape how ambitious the roadmap can be?[17][18]
- How will we align the roadmap with organizational strategy and future skills needs?[10][1]
- What data will we collect to know if the roadmap is improving performance and development?[14][5]
- How often will the roadmap be reviewed and revised as the profession evolves?[18][7]
- How will we support managers to use the roadmap in career and performance conversations?[19][20]
- How do we make the roadmap visible and understandable to practitioners at all levels?[15]
- What risks exist if we *don’t* have a clear roadmap (misaligned expectations, stalled careers, weak capability)?[3]
