📄 Content Labeling Types - Table of Contents
The 16 Major Labeling Categories:

Hierarchical Classification Labels - Traditional taxonomy structure (Domain → Category → Subcategory → Topic → Subtopic → Element)
Content Type Labels - What the content IS (Conceptual, Technical, Operational, etc.)
Purpose-Based Labels - WHY the content exists (Educational, Informational, Transactional, etc.)
Audience & Context Labels - WHO it's for (Expertise levels, roles, departments, industries)
Temporal & Lifecycle Labels - WHEN and status (Current, Draft, Published, Archived, etc.)
Quality & Reliability Labels - How GOOD it is (Quality scores, verification status, evidence levels)
Relational & Semantic Labels - How it CONNECTS (Parent-child, prerequisites, synonyms, related terms)
Analytical & Metrics Labels - MEASUREMENT focused (Descriptive, predictive, KPIs, metrics)
Compliance & Regulatory Labels - LEGAL requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, data sensitivity)
Organizational & Structural Labels - How it's ORGANIZED (Sections, modules, chapters)
Skill & Competency Labels - LEARNING focused (Hard skills, soft skills, Bloom's taxonomy)
Problem-Solving Focus Labels - SOLUTION oriented (Diagnostic, optimization, troubleshooting)
Application & Use Case Labels - PRACTICAL usage (Best practices, templates, case studies)
Engagement & Interaction Labels - USER behavior (Quick reference, deep dive, interactive)
Special Classification Labels - INDUSTRY specific (Web security, marketing funnel, sales enablement)
Custom & Extensible Labels - FLEXIBLE additions (Project-specific, dynamic, composite)

Key Features of the TOC:

Multi-dimensional approach: Each piece of content can have multiple label types applied simultaneously
Hierarchical organization: Shows parent-child relationships within each labeling system
Practical examples: Includes common label combinations for different content types
Cross-system mapping: Shows how labels translate between different classification systems
Implementation tiers: Prioritizes which labels are essential vs. optional

Think of this as your "labeling menu" - you can pick and choose which types of labels to apply based on your specific needs. For example, a technical document might use:

Hierarchical: Technology > Documentation > API Reference
Content Type: Technical (T)
Purpose: Educational
Audience: Developer
Quality: Verified
Lifecycle: Current

This modular approach lets you create rich, multi-faceted classifications while keeping the system flexible and manageable.
