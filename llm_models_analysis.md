# LLM BEST MODELS (OPINION)

Kimi K2 Thinking: strong reasoning and chain-of-thought model; performs well on analytical writing and Q&A.

GLM 4.6: very balanced model for multilingual and academic tasks, with a solid open-source ecosystem.

Qwen 3 Coder / Qwen 3.5: outstanding open models for programming and data-centric use. Cost-efficient and surprisingly accurate.

Claude Sonnet 4.5: excels at summarization, safe reasoning, and complex document analysis. Perfect for enterprise or multi-file tasks

GPT-5: unmatched in reasoning, code debugging, and long-context understanding. Great for research, writing, and structured workflows.

What surprised me most wasn’t the differences. it was the parallels. For almost every closed model, there’s an open-source counterpart catching up fast:

Sonnet 4.5 → GLM 4.6 / Minimax M2

Grok Code Fast → GPT-OSS 120B / Qwen 3 Coder

GPT-5 → Kimi K2 / Kimi K2 Thinking

Gemini 2.5 Flash → Qwen 2.5 Image

Gemini 2.5 Pro → Qwen 3-235-A22B

Sonnet 4 → Qwen 3 Coder
