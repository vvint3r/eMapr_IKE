Below is a **structured overview** of the responsibilities and focus areas a seasoned Marketing Analytics professional typically manages when joining a new organization. It follows a rough chronological order—from **initial onboarding** to more **advanced, long-term** initiatives.

---

## 1. **Onboarding & Immediate Assessment**

**a) Data Landscape & Key Metrics**

* **Audit Existing Data**: Review current data sources (CRM, web analytics, ad platforms, transactional data).
* **Identify Primary KPIs**: Clarify the organization’s top-level success metrics (revenue, CAC, ROI/ROAS, retention rates).
* **Check Data Quality**: Assess data accuracy, consistency, and completeness (e.g., are UTMs tracked correctly? Is data siloed or integrated?).

**b) Stakeholder Alignment**

* **Meet Cross-Functional Teams**: Marketing, Product, Finance, and Data Engineering to understand their needs.
* **Clarify Responsibilities**: Understand who owns which data sources and how frequently reports/insights are expected.
* **Set Expectations**: Communicate your focus areas (attribution, dashboards, modeling) and timeline for deliverables.

## 2. **Data Infrastructure & Governance**

**a) Data Architecture Review**

* **Data Warehouse**: Evaluate existing solutions (BigQuery, Redshift, etc.) for scalability and performance.
* **ETL/ELT Processes**: Review pipelines (e.g., Airflow, Fivetran, dbt) to ensure consistent data ingestion and transformations.
* **BI & Dashboarding Tools**: Confirm the tool stack (Tableau, Power BI, Looker) aligns with data infrastructure.

**b) Governance & Data Dictionary**

* **Data Ownership & Access**: Establish who can access which data (e.g., role-based permissions).
* **Standard Definitions**: Create a centralized data dictionary (e.g., LTV, churn, CAC), ensuring consistent reporting across departments.
* **Privacy & Compliance**: Ensure alignment with regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and manage user consent frameworks.

## 3. **Establishing Core Reporting & Quick Wins**

**a) Baseline Dashboards & Reporting**

* **Executive Dashboard**: Build or refine top-level dashboards for leadership (e.g., weekly or monthly business reviews).
* **Channel-Specific Reports**: Provide granular insights on SEO, paid search, display, social, and email performance.
* **Conversion Funnel Tracking**: Set up funnel analytics to identify drop-off points and opportunities for optimization.

**b) Quick Wins & Low-Hanging Fruit**

* **Data Cleanup**: Fix inconsistent naming conventions, unify campaign tags, ensure funnel events are properly tracked.
* **Attribution Fixes**: Address any immediate gaps in attribution (e.g., double counting, missing last-touch data).
* **Automated Alerts**: Implement triggers or alerts for anomalies (sudden CTR drops, unexpected CPA spikes).

## 4. **Scaling & Advanced Analytics**

**a) Attribution Modeling & Experimentation**

* **Multi-Touch Attribution**: Evaluate if the company is ready for advanced models (e.g., data-driven or algorithmic).
* **Incremental & Lift Tests**: Implement holdout groups or geo-based experiments to measure true channel lift.
* **A/B & Multivariate Testing**: Systematically test channel strategies, landing pages, creative, and audience targeting.

**b) Predictive & Prescriptive Analytics**

* **CLV & Churn Models**: Use regression or machine learning methods (e.g., gradient boosting, random forests) to predict lifetime value, churn propensity, and optimal re-engagement.
* **Forecasting & Budget Allocation**: Build forecasting models for revenue or lead volumes, informing budget and resource planning (e.g., marketing mix modeling).
* **Segmentation & Personalization**: Use RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) or custom cluster analyses to tailor marketing strategies and messaging.

## 5. **Team Building & Cross-Functional Collaboration**

**a) Team Structure & Skills**

* **Hiring & Mentoring**: Add specialists (data scientists, analysts, data engineers) or upskill existing team members.
* **Collaboration Models**: Establish how analytics integrates with marketing squads, product pods, or ops teams (e.g., agile sprints, cross-functional projects).
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Set up internal training on analytics best practices, data quality, and performance measurement.

**b) Stakeholder Engagement**

* **Regular Updates**: Present insights to executives and other stakeholders.
* **Data-Driven Culture**: Advocate for experimentation and evidence-based decision-making across the organization.
* **Feedback Loops**: Gather feedback on reporting and insights, iterating to meet evolving business needs.
