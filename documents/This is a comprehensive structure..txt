## Key Analytics Considerations:

| Consideration | Airbnb Focus | Shopify Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Attribution Models** | Multi-touch (e.g., U-shaped, data-driven) is critical to value both the upper-funnel brand campaigns (e.g., CTV) and the lower-funnel performance channels (e.g., SEM) that drive the final booking. | Multi-touch is important for tracking leads through the marketing/sales funnel (from first content view to paid subscription). Often relies heavily on first-touch or lead-creation touch for initial lead score. |
| **Incrementality Testing** | High priority for **Paid Search** (to ensure brand spend isn't cannibalizing organic traffic) and **Retargeting/Display** (to confirm ads cause a booking that wouldn't have happened naturally). | Crucial for **Paid Social** and **Programmatic** to ensure acquired merchants are *new* and not just accelerated sign-ups. Testing on promotional offers (e.g., extended free trials). |
| **Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM)** | Essential for allocating budget between **Traditional (TV/OOH)** and **Digital (Meta/Google)** to understand the overall macro-impact on **Total Bookings/Nights Booked**. | Important for macro-budget allocation across product lines (Shopify vs. Shopify Plus vs. Partner Program) and overall **Subscription Revenue Growth**. |
| **Channel-specific KPIs** | Focus on **CAC** (Host vs. Guest), **LTV** (High LTV Guest/Host segments), **Nights Booked**, **Listing Quality/Satisfaction Score**, and **ROAS** (for specific booking funnels). | Focus on **MAC/CAC** (Subscription Cost), **LTV** (Merchant Lifetime Value), **Churn Rate**, **Average Contract Value (ACV)**, and **Lead Quality Score**. |
| **Cross-channel Measurement Challenges** | Linking **Offline (TV)** exposure to online booking behavior. Measuring the value of **Host Acquisition** efforts which have a very long conversion cycle compared to Guest bookings. | Measuring the collective impact of marketing on **Partner/Developer Ecosystem Growth** which indirectly drives merchant acquisition. Attributing value in a B2B sales cycle that involves multiple decision-makers. |
| **Upper vs. Lower Funnel Metrics** | **Upper:** Brand awareness, Brand Search Volume, Brand Lift, Ad Recall, CPV. **Lower:** CPA, ROAS, Booking Conversion Rate, Install Rate. | **Upper:** Lead Volume, Content Downloads, MQL Volume, Cost Per Engaged User. **Lower:** Trial Sign-ups, SQL Volume, CPA/MAC, LTV. |
| **Brand vs. Performance Marketing Measurement** | Brand metrics (like Brand Lift) are used to justify large-scale TV and Social awareness spending, while performance metrics (like ROAS) optimize day-to-day SEM and Retargeting campaigns. | Brand marketing focuses on establishing trust and authority in the commerce space (measured by **Thought Leadership** and **Brand Sentiment**), while performance drives direct **Trial Sign-ups** and **Paid Subscriptions**. |
