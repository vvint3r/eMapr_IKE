### 0-6-12 Month Roadmap for a **New Analytics Manager**

The sequence below assumes you are hired to run a small-to-mid-sized analytics team (4-10 FTEs) that partners with product, marketing, and engineering.  Each time-box is organized around five pillars that matter most at this level: **People, Domain, Process & Tooling, Delivery, Governance & Culture**.

## PRE-START (week –2 → Day 0)

| Pillar               | Actions                                                                                                                                                                                   | Artefacts                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| People               | • Ask recruiter for the org-chart, recent performance reviews (redacted), and open headcount.<br>• Book 1-on-1 intros with direct reports and “critical friends” (product, eng, finance). | 30-min intro slots on calendar |

| Delivery             | Ask for “Top 5 painful unanswered questions” from each exec.                                                                                                                              | Backlog seed                   |
| Governance & Culture | Read data policy, SLAs, model-risk framework, security training.                                                                                                                          | Compliance sign-off            |

## DAYS 61-90 “ACCELERATE”

| Pillar                   | Objectives                                                                                                                                         | Success Signals             |

## MONTH 4-6 “OPTIMIZE”

1. **People** – formal mentorship pairing, succession plans, performance criteria tied to OKRs.
2. **Domain** – quarterly roadmap refresh; socialize a KPI deprecation framework.
3. **Process & Tooling** – migrate legacy ETLs to dbt; implement automated cost monitoring in BigQuery.
4. **Delivery** – institutionalize an “experiment review board”; publish reusable notebook templates.
5. **Governance & Culture** – run a data-literacy workshop for non-technical teams (HBR highlights this as a key unlock for org-wide data fluency) ([hbr.org][5]).

---

## MONTH 7-12 “STRATEGIZE & SCALE”

| Goal                           | Key Milestones                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Org & Talent**               | • Complete team skills matrix → training budget.<br>• Split team into **Analytics Engineering** vs **Insights & Science** pods with clear charters. |
| **Platform Evolution**         | • Evaluate buy-vs-build for observability or experimentation platforms.                                                                             |
| **Portfolio Management**       | • Introduce a quarterly **“analytics OKR demo day.”**<br>• Score all projects on impact/effort → cull low-ROI work.                                 |
| **Cross-Functional Influence** | • Co-lead annual planning offsite; set company-level *Data Maturity* targets.                                                                       |
| **Thought Leadership**         | • Speak at internal town-hall; optionally publish a blog or conference talk to aid hiring brand.                                                    |

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Data Quality    | % Freshness SLA met                              | ≥ 98 %             |

### Templates & Artifacts to Prepare

* 30-60-90 PDF (one page)
* IDP Google Sheets per report
* KPI Catalog in dbt `docs/`
* Analytics Intake Form (Google Form + Slack alert)
* Incident Post-mortem Template (Markdown)
* Quarterly Business Review slide deck

---

#### Final Advice

* **Sequence “Listen → Learn → Lead.”** Jumping to re-architecture on Day 1 alienates teams; quick-wins earn capital first.
* **Anchor everything in business outcomes.** Stakeholders remember revenue saved or growth unlocked, not model F1-scores.
* **Invest in culture early.** High trust multiplies every engineering or statistical improvement you later introduce ([locallyoptimistic.com][6]).

Use this roadmap as your north star, but tailor each deliverable to your company’s maturity and appetite for change. Good luck—your first year sets the trajectory for both you *and* your analytics function.
