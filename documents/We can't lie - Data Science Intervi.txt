Probability & Statistics Concepts To Review Before Your Data Science Interview
Because probability & statistics is foundational to the field of Data Science, before the interview you should review:

Probability Basics & Random Variables
Probability Distributions
Hypothesis Testing
Regression Analysis
In case these statistical concepts sound alien to you, check out some of our favorite Statistics Books for Data Analysts to get a gentle refresher.

Probability Basics and Random Variables
The beginnings of probability start with thinking about sample spaces, basic counting and combinatorial principles. Although it is not necessary to know all of the ins-and-outs of combinatorics, it is helpful to understand the basics for simplifying problems. One classic example here is the “stars and bars” counting method.

The other core topic to study is random variables. Knowing concepts related to expectation, variance, covariance, along with the basic probability distributions is crucial.

Probability Distributions
For modeling random variables, knowing the basics of various probability distributions is essential. Understanding both discrete and continuous examples, combined with expectations and variances, is crucial. The most common distributions discussed in interviews are the Uniform and Normal but there are plenty of other well-known distributions for particular use cases (Poisson, Binomial, Geometric).

Most of the time knowing the basics and their applications should suffice. For example, which distribution would flipping a coin be under? What about waiting for an event? It never hurts being able to do the derivations for expectation, variance, or other higher moments.

Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis testing is the backbone behind statistical inference and can be broken down into a couple of topics. The first is the Central Limit Theorem, which plays an important role in studying large samples of data. Other core elements of hypothesis testing: sampling distributions, p-values, confidence intervals, type I and II errors. Lastly, it is worth looking at various tests involving proportions, and other hypothesis tests.

Most of these concepts play a crucial role in A/B testing, which is a commonly asked topic during interviews at consumer-tech companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Uber. It's useful to not only understand the technical details but also conceptually how A/B testing operates, what the assumptions are, possible pitfalls, and applications to real-life products.

Modeling
Modeling relies on a strong understanding of probability distributions and hypothesis testing. Since it is a broad term, we will refer to modeling as the areas which have a strong statistical intersection with Machine Learning. This includes topics such as: linear regression, maximum likelihood estimation, & bayesian statistics. For interviews focused on modeling and machine learning, knowing these topics is essential.

20 Probability Interview Problems Asked By Top-Tech Companies & Wall Street
[Facebook - Easy] [Coin Fairness Test on DataLemur] There is a fair coin (one side heads, one side tails) and an unfair coin (both sides tails). You pick one at random, flip it 5 times, and observe that it comes up as tails all five times. What is the chance that you are flipping the unfair coin?
[Lyft - Easy] You and your friend are playing a game. The two of you will continue to toss a coin until the sequence HH or TH shows up. If HH shows up first, you win. If TH shows up first, your friend wins. What is the probability of you winning?
[Google - Easy] What is the probability that a seven-game series goes to 7 games?
[Facebook - Easy] Facebook has a content team that labels pieces of content on the platform as spam or not spam. 90% of them are diligent raters and will label 20% of the content as spam and 80% as non-spam. The remaining 10% are non-diligent raters and will label 0% of the content as spam and 100% as non-spam. Assume the pieces of content are labeled independently from one another, for every rater. Given that a rater has labeled 4 pieces of content as good, what is the probability that they are a diligent rater?
[Bloomberg - Easy] Say you draw a circle and choose two chords at random. What is the probability that those chords will intersect?
[Amazon - Easy] 1/1000 people have a particular disease, and there is a test that is 98% correct if you have the disease. If you don’t have the disease, there is a 1% error rate. If someone tests positive, what are the odds they have the disease?
[Facebook - Easy] There are 50 cards of 5 different colors. Each color has cards numbered between 1 to 10. You pick 2 cards at random. What is the probability that they are not of same color and also not of same number?

[Facebook - Easy] What is the expected number of rolls needed to see all 6 sides of a fair die?
