1. Understanding the Role: Advanced Analytics, Sr. Manager, Marketing 
From the job description you provided, this role is not just about technical skills; it's a 
leadership position that requires a blend of technical expertise, business acumen, and strong 
communication skills. Here's a breakdown of what Airbnb is looking for: 
● Leadership & Management: You'll be leading a team of analysts, so be prepared to 
talk about your management style, how you mentor and develop team members, and 
your experience in leading projects. 
● Technical Expertise: 
○ SQL is a must: Hive and Presto are the flavors of SQL they use. 
○ Advanced Analytics: This includes statistical modeling, experimentation (A/B 
testing), and causal inference. 
○ Data Storytelling: You need to be able to translate complex data into 
actionable insights for stakeholders. 
● Business Acumen & Strategy: 
○ Marketing Focus: Understand the nuances of marketing analytics, including 
campaign measurement, customer segmentation, and marketing channel 
optimization. 
○ Product Sense: The case study will test your ability to measure product 
development and define product metrics. 
○ Strategic Thinking: You'll be working with senior stakeholders, so you need to 
demonstrate that you can think strategically and align your team's work with 
the company's goals. 
● Collaboration: You'll be working with various teams (Finance, Data Engineering, Data 
Science), so be ready to discuss your collaboration and stakeholder management 
skills. 
2. Mastering the SQL Technical Interview 
The technical screen will focus on "basic and intermediate SQL." While they say you can look 
up syntax, you should still have a strong command of the concepts. Here's how to prepare: 
Key SQL Concepts to Master: 
● Joining Tables: 
○ INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN. 
○ Be prepared to explain the differences and when to use each. 
○ Self-Joins: These are explicitly mentioned, so practice problems that involve 
joining a table to itself. 
● Aggregating and Filtering: 
○ GROUP BY and aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN). 
○ WHERE vs. HAVING: Understand the order of operations and when to use each. 
● Subqueries: 
○ Practice using subqueries in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses. 
○ Understand the difference between correlated and non-correlated subqueries. 
● Window Functions: This is an intermediate/advanced topic that they've called out. 
Master these: 
○ ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(): For ranking items. 
○ LEAD(), LAG(): For accessing data in subsequent or preceding rows. 
○ SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() as window functions with OVER(PARTITION BY ...): For 
running totals and moving averages. 
● Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Using the WITH clause to break down complex 
queries and improve readability. 
Practice Platforms: 
● DataLemur: Created by the author of "Ace the Data Science Interview," this site has a 
great collection of SQL interview questions from top tech companies. 
● StrataScratch: Offers real interview questions from companies like Airbnb, with a 
built-in SQL editor to practice. 
● LeetCode: Known for software engineering questions, but its database section has 
excellent SQL problems. 
Hive and Presto Specifics: 
● Hive and Presto are SQL query engines designed for big data. While the syntax is very 
similar to standard SQL, it's good to be aware of some differences, especially in 
performance and available functions. A quick search for "Hive vs. Presto syntax" will 
give you the key distinctions. For the interview, a strong grasp of standard SQL will be 
sufficient. 
3. Nailing the Case Study Interview 
The case study will assess your product sense and analytical thinking. They want to see how 
you structure your thoughts and approach a problem. Here's a framework to guide you: 
The CIRCLES Method™ for Product Case Studies: 
This is a popular framework for product-related case studies. It's a great way to structure your 
response: 
1. C - Clarify: Ask clarifying questions to understand the problem fully. What's the goal? 
Who are the users? What are the constraints? 
2. I - Identify Users: Who are the key user segments for this product or feature? (For 
Airbnb, this is often Hosts and Guests). 
3. R - Report on User Needs: What are the pain points and needs of these users? 
4. C - Cut Through and Prioritize: Brainstorm potential solutions or metrics, then 
prioritize them based on impact and effort. 
5. L - List Solutions: Detail your proposed solutions or analytical approaches. 
6. E - Evaluate Trade-offs: Discuss the pros and cons of your proposed solutions. 
7. S - Summarize: Conclude with a clear summary of your recommendation and next 
steps. 
Example Case Study Prompt: 
"We've just launched a new feature that allows guests to add ‘experiences’ to their bookings. 
How would you measure the success of this feature?" 
Applying a Framework to the Example: 
1. Clarify: 
○ "What is the primary goal of this feature? Is it to increase revenue, improve user 
engagement, or drive more bookings?" 
○ "Is this feature available on all platforms (web, iOS, Android)?" 
○ "What is the timeline for measuring success (e.g., first week, first month, first 
quarter)?" 
2. Define Success Metrics: Structure your metrics into categories. For Airbnb, a 
two-sided marketplace, consider both sides. 
○ Guest-Side Metrics (The User): 
■ Adoption Rate: % of users who see the feature vs. % who interact with 
it. 
■ Conversion Rate: % of users who book an experience after seeing the 
feature. 
■ Average Order Value (AOV): How much does the feature add to the 
average booking value? 
■ User Satisfaction: Net Promoter Score (NPS) or user surveys on the 
new feature. 
■ Retention: Do users who book experiences have a higher retention rate 
than those who don't? 
○ Host-Side Metrics (The Provider): 
■ Host Engagement: # of hosts creating experiences. 
■ Host Revenue: Increase in earnings for hosts offering experiences. 
■ Host Satisfaction: NPS from hosts on the new feature. 
○ Ecosystem Metrics (The Business): 
■ Overall Revenue: Incremental revenue generated by the feature. 
■ Impact on Core Business: Does this feature lead to more or fewer 
accommodation bookings? (This is a "guardrail" metric to ensure the 
new feature isn't hurting the core business). 
3. Propose an Analytical Approach: 
○ A/B Testing: This is the gold standard. "I would propose an A/B test where a 
control group of users does not see the new feature, and a treatment group 
does. We can then compare the key metrics between the two groups to 
measure the causal impact of the feature." 
○ Pre-Post Analysis (if A/B testing isn't possible): "If an A/B test isn't feasible, 
we could do a pre-post analysis, comparing user behavior before and after the 
feature launch. We would need to be mindful of seasonality and other external 
factors." 
4. Data and Dashboarding: 
○ "To track these metrics, I would work with the data engineering team to ensure 
the necessary data is being logged. Then, I would create a dashboard in a tool 
like Tableau or Superset to monitor the performance of the feature in 
real-time." 
4. Airbnb-Specific Preparation 
Show them you've done your homework. Spend some time researching: 
● Airbnb's Business Model: Understand how they make money, their key markets, and 
their competitive landscape. 
● Recent Product Launches: What new features have they launched recently? Think 
about how you would measure their success. 
● Marketing Campaigns: Look at their recent marketing campaigns. What channels are 
they using? Who are they targeting? 
● The Travel Industry: Be aware of the current trends in the travel and hospitality 
industry. 
5. General Interview Tips 
● Think Out Loud: During both the technical and case study portions, communicate 
your thought process. They want to see how you think, not just the final answer. 
● Prepare Your Questions: Have thoughtful questions ready to ask your interviewers. 
This shows your interest and engagement. Examples: 
○ "What is the biggest analytical challenge the marketing team is currently 
facing?" 
○ "How does the data and analytics team collaborate with the marketing and 
product teams?" 
○ "What does success look like for someone in this role in the first 6-12 months?" 
● Be a Storyteller: When answering behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time 
when..."), use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your 
answers and make them compelling.
