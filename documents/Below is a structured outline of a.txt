This is organized as if you’ve just joined a new company in this role and are planning out responsibilities over your first few months and beyond. The timeline is broken into rough phases—Weeks 1-4 (first month), Weeks 5-8 (second month), Weeks 9-12 (third month), and Ongoing Responsibilities. Of course, actual timelines may vary based on organizational size, maturity, and available resources.
