# Web App Example: TaskFlow - Complete Product Development Templates

## Project Overview: TaskFlow
**A task management web app for freelancers that automatically tracks time and generates invoices**

This document contains actual templates and frameworks following a real project from concept to launch.

---

## Phase 1: Discovery & Validation (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Problem Discovery Canvas

**Problem Statement:**
Freelancers waste 5-8 hours weekly on administrative tasks: tracking time across projects, creating invoices, and managing task priorities across multiple clients.

**Initial Hypothesis:**
If we create a unified task management system that automatically tracks time and generates invoices, freelancers can reduce admin time by 70% and increase billable hours.

**Target User:**
- **Primary:** Solo freelancers managing 3-8 clients simultaneously
- **Secondary:** Small agencies (2-5 people) without dedicated project managers
- **Anti-persona:** Large agencies with existing enterprise tools

### 1.2 Customer Interview Script & Results

**Interview Questions Template:**
```
Opening:
"Tell me about your typical workday as a freelancer."

Problem Discovery:
1. "Walk me through how you currently manage tasks across different clients."
2. "What's the most frustrating part of tracking your work hours?"
3. "How do you handle invoicing? What takes the most time?"
4. "Have you tried solving this problem before? What did/didn't work?"

Solution Testing:
5. "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about your workflow, what would it be?"
6. "How much would you pay to save 5 hours per week on admin tasks?"
```

**Interview Synthesis (10 interviews conducted):**
| Pain Point | Frequency | Severity (1-5) | Quote |
|------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Switching between tools | 10/10 | 4.5 | "I use Trello for tasks, Toggl for time, and Wave for invoices" |
| Forgetting to track time | 8/10 | 5 | "I lose $500-1000/month from untracked time" |
| Manual invoice creation | 9/10 | 3.5 | "Takes 2 hours every two weeks, tedious but necessary" |
| Client task visibility | 6/10 | 3 | "Clients always ask for updates I've already sent" |

### 1.3 Lean Canvas (One-Page Business Model)

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Problem** | 1. Time tracking across multiple tools<br>2. Manual invoice generation<br>3. Lost billable hours |
| **Solution** | Unified task management with automatic time tracking and invoice generation |
| **Key Metrics** | - User activation rate (>60%)<br>- Weekly active users<br>- Revenue per user ($29/month target) |
| **Unique Value Prop** | "Stop losing money to admin work - track tasks, time, and invoices in one place" |
| **Unfair Advantage** | Deep integration between tasks and invoicing (competitors do one or the other) |
| **Channels** | - Product Hunt launch<br>- Freelancer communities (Reddit, Discord)<br>- Content marketing (productivity tips) |
| **Customer Segments** | Freelancers billing $2,000-$10,000/month across multiple clients |
| **Cost Structure** | - Hosting: $50/month<br>- Payment processing: 2.9%<br>- Development time: 200 hours |
| **Revenue Streams** | - SaaS subscription: $29/month<br>- Payment processing markup: 0.5% |

## Key Learnings & Tips

**What Works for Solo Builders:**
1. Ship weekly - momentum matters more than perfection
2. Talk to users constantly - 3 conversations > 100 surveys  
3. Say no to 80% of feature requests - focus wins
4. Document everything - future you will thank you
5. Use boring technology - proven > trendy

**Common Traps to Avoid:**
1. Building features nobody asked for
2. Perfecting instead of shipping
3. Ignoring customer support
4. Not charging enough
5. Comparing to VC-funded competitors

**Remember:** You're not building the next Asana. You're solving a specific problem for a specific group of people better than anyone else. Stay focused, stay lean, and keep shipping.
