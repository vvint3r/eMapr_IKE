**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:bi|head='Probability'

In a random experiment, probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. The number of favorable outcomes in an experiment with n outcomes is denoted by x. The following is the formula for calculating the probability of an event:

**Probability (Event) \= Favorable Outcomes / Total Outcomes \= x/n**

Let's look at a simple application to better understand probability. If we need to know if it's raining or not, there are two possible answers to this question: "Yes" or "No." It is possible that it will rain or not rain. In this case, we can make use of probability. The concept of probability is used to forecast the outcomes of coin tosses, dice rolls, and card draws from a deck of playing cards.

**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:r|head='Complement'

Ac, the complement of an event A in a sample space S, is the collection of all outcomes in S that are not members of set A. It is equivalent to rejecting any verbal description of event A.

**P(A) \+ P(A') \= 1**

### Block 8

**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:bi|head='Intersection'

The intersection of events is a collection of all outcomes that are components of both sets A and B. It is equivalent to combining descriptions of the two events with the word "and."

**P(A∩B) \= P(A)P(B)**

### Block 9

**Original headings:** End to End Statistics for Data Science > Properties of Statistics > Union

**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:bi|head='Union'

The union of events is the collection of all outcomes that are members of one or both sets A and B. It is equivalent to combining descriptions of the two events with the word "or."

**P(A ∪ B) \= P(A) \+ P(B) − P(A∩B)**

### Block 10

**Source:** `md`  
**Original headings:** End to End Statistics for Data Science > Properties of Statistics > Conditional Probability

**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:bi|head='Conditional Probability'

P(A|B) is a measure of the likelihood of one event happening in relation to one or more other events. When P(B) \> 0:

**P(A|B) \= P(A∩B) / P(B)**

### Block 11

**Original headings:** End to End Statistics for Data Science > Properties of Statistics > Independent Events

**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:r|head='Independent Events'

Two events are considered independent if the occurrence of one has no effect on the likelihood of the occurrence of the other.

**P(A∩B) \= P(A)P(B)** where P(A) ≠ 0 and P(B) ≠ 0

For independent events: P(A|B) \= P(A) and P(B|A) \= P(B)

### Block 12

**Source:** `md`  
**Original headings:** End to End Statistics for Data Science > Properties of Statistics > Mutually Exclusive Events

**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:r|head='Mutually Exclusive Events'

If events A and B share no elements, they are mutually exclusive. Because A and B have no outcomes in common, it is impossible for both A and B to occur on a single trial of the random experiment. This results in the following rule:

**P(A∩B) \= 0**

Any event A and its complement Ac are mutually exclusive if and only if A and B are mutually exclusive, but A and B can be mutually exclusive without being complements.

**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:r|head='Percentiles, Quartiles and Interquartile Range (IQR)'

**Percentiles**: A statistical unit of measurement that indicates the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For instance, the 40th percentile represents the value below which 40% of the observations fall.

**Quartiles**: Values that divide the number of data points into four more or less equal parts, or quarters. Quartiles are the 0th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentile values.

**Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The difference between the third and first quartiles. The partitioned values that divide the entire series into four equal parts are known as quartiles. The first quartile, known as the lower quartile, is denoted by Q1, the second quartile by Q2, and the third quartile by Q3, known as the upper quartile.

**IQR \= Upper Quartile − Lower Quartile \= Q3 − Q1**

**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:r|head='2\) “Lift” vs “Conversion Rate” — the precise statistical difference'

Definitions:

* Conversion rate (CR): (\\text{CR} \= \\frac{\\text{conversions}}{\\text{visitors}}).

* Lift (absolute): (d \= \\text{CR}\_B \- \\text{CR}\_A).

* Lift (relative %): (\\frac{\\text{CR}\_B \- \\text{CR}\_A}{\\text{CR}\_A}\\times100%).

* Statistical lift: the estimate of (d) with uncertainty: (\\hat d \\pm \\text{CI}).

Airbnb example:  
 Control CR on listing page \= 3.0%, treatment CR \= 3.6%.

* Absolute lift (= \+0.6)pp.

* Relative lift (= 0.6/3.0 \= \+20%).

* Statistically, you’ll report estimate \+ CI \+ p-value and often a decision (“ship/iterate/stop”).

Interview phrasing:

* “Conversion rate is the level; lift is the difference between levels and is what we test. We care about the CI of lift to judge practical significance, not just p-value.”

**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:r|head='Challenges You Might Face'

Now let's start with understanding some challenges you guys might be faced with. Because many people like to speak from experience, if you don't have real experience on AB testing, you might be thinking, how can I talk about something I have never done to convince the hiring manager that I have experience and knowledge about it? If you know you are going to get AB testing questions in the interview, you might be defeated before the interview. Automatically right away you feel you cannot land the job and you cannot do the job, and that will impact your performance in the interview. Understandably, it is hard for you to show up confidently in the interview and you might feel negative about the interview experience.

Another challenge that I hear many data scientists talking about is even if I want to acquire the knowledge on AB testing, I don't know the best way to do it. What would be the best way for me to acquire AB testing knowledge given that I don't have any experience with watching videos or reading books, enough to gain the knowledge? If any of what I mentioned resonates with you, I want to share with you this good news. You don't need to have real experience to ace AB testing interview questions. You can acquire the knowledge by watching videos, reading books, blog posts, et cetera, and I actually have a few YouTube videos on AB testing.

More importantly, you enhance your learning by practicing how to present your approach to solve AB testing interview questions. Ideally, you get some practice by doing mock interviews so that you can get some feedback and know where and how to improve. In this video, we are going to look at some AB testing questions that come up over and over again in interviews, and I'm going to offer you a strategy to approach the top one AB testing interview question.

**Mapping:** score=0.61 reason=keyword:r|head='The benefits of product experimentation'

Product experimentation offers significant advantages for teams looking to build better products:

* Faster decision-making: By validating ideas quickly with real user data, teams can reduce guesswork and move with greater confidence

* Lower risk: Testing changes on a small scale helps catch potential issues before they impact the broader user base

* Increased user engagement: Experiments reveal what truly resonates with users and can help create more personalized and effective experiences

* Improved product-market fit: Insights gained through testing can guide the development of features that your users actually want and value

Running a great experiment starts with a solid idea, but it takes the right tools to execute, measure, and learn at speed. A well-built experimentation stack helps you do exactly that: ship confidently, analyze impact quickly, and iterate without friction.

Here’s a breakdown of the modern experimentation stack most high-performing product and growth teams rely on.
