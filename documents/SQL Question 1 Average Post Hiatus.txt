posts Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
post_id	integer
post_date	timestamp
post_content	text
posts Example Input:
user_id	post_id	post_date	post_content
151652	599415	07/10/2024 12:00:00	Need a hug
661093	624356	07/29/2024 13:00:00	Bed. Class 8-12. Work 12-3. Gym 3-5 or 6. Then class 6-10. Another day that's gonna fly by. I miss my girlfriend
004239	784254	07/04/2024 11:00:00	Happy 4th of July!
661093	442560	07/08/2024 14:00:00	Just going to cry myself to sleep after watching Marley and Me.
151652	111766	07/12/2024 19:00:00	I'm so done with covid - need traveling ASAP!
Example Output:
user_id	days_between
151652	2
661093	21
Answer:
First, we can use the MIN() and MAX() aggregate functions on the post_date column to retrieve the earliest and latest post dates, and substract one from another accordingly.

To calculate the difference for each user, we GROUP the results by user_id, and then filter for posts made in the year 2024. To do so, we use the DATE_PART() function to extract the year from the post_date column.

In the final step, to exclude users who have posted only once during the year, we apply the HAVING clause with a COUNT() condition greater than 1.

This yields the final solution:

SELECT 
	user_id, 
    MAX(post_date::DATE) - MIN(post_date::DATE) AS days_between
FROM posts
WHERE DATE_PART('year', post_date::DATE) = 2024 
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(post_id) > 1;

SQL Question 2: Facebook Power Users
A Facebook power user is defined as someone who posts a ton, and gets a lot of reactions on their post. For the purpose of this question, consider a Facebook power user as someone who posts at least twice a day and receives an average of 150 comments and/or reactions per post.

Write a SQL query to return the IDs of all Facebook power users, along with the number of posts, and the average number of reactions per post.

Use the following tables "user_post" and "post_interactions":

user_post Example Input:
user_id	post_id	post_date
1	1001	2024-09-01
1	1002	2024-09-01
2	1003	2024-09-02
2	1004	2024-09-03
1	1005	2024-09-02
post_interactions Example Input:
post_id	comments	reactions
1001	75	200
1002	85	250
1004	60	90
1005	100	150
1003	50	70
Answer:
SELECT
    up.user_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT up.post_id) AS no_of_posts,
    AVG(pi.comments + pi.reactions) AS avg_interaction_per_post
FROM
    user_post up
JOIN
    post_interactions pi on up.post_id = pi.post_id
GROUP BY
    up.user_id
HAVING
    COUNT(DISTINCT up.post_id) >= 2 AND AVG(pi.comments + pi.reactions) >= 150

SQL QUESTION 3: Can you explain the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
The HAVING clause works similarly to the WHERE clause, but it is used to filter the groups of rows created by the GROUP BY clause rather than the rows of the table themselves.

For example, say you were analyzing Facebook ads data:

SELECT region, SUM(sales)
FROM facebook_ads
WHERE date > '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY region
HAVING SUM(sales) > 500000;
This query retrieves the total sales from all ads in each region, and uses the WHERE clause to only sales made after January 1, 2024. The rows are then grouped by region and the HAVING clause filters the groups to include only those with total sales greater than $500k.

SQL Question 4: Active User Retention
Assume you're given a table containing information on Facebook user actions. Write a SQL query to obtain number of monthly active users (MAUs) in July 2022, including the month in numerical format "1, 2, 3".

Hint: An active user is defined as a user who has performed actions such as 'sign-in', 'like', or 'comment' in both the current month and the previous month.

user_actions Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
event_id	integer
event_type	string ("sign-in, "like", "comment")
event_date	datetime
user_actionsExample Input:
user_id	event_id	event_type	event_date
445	7765	sign-in	06/31/2022 12:00:00
742	6458	sign-in	07/03/2022 12:00:00
445	3634	like	07/05/2022 12:00:00
742	1374	comment	07/05/2022 12:00:00
648	3124	like	07/18/2022 12:00:00
Example Output for June 2022:
month	monthly_active_users
6	1
In July 2022, there was only one monthly active user (MAU) with the user_id 445.

Answer
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date) AS mth, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT curr_month.user_id) AS monthly_active_users 
FROM user_actions AS curr_month
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT last_month.user_id 
  FROM user_actions AS last_month
  WHERE last_month.user_id = curr_month.user_id
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM last_month.event_date) =
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date - interval '1 month')
)
  AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date) = 7
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM curr_month.event_date) = 2022
GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM curr_month.event_date);

SQL QUESTION 5: What's the difference between a left and right join?
In SQL, a join generally retrieves rows from multiple tables and combines them into a single result set. For an example of the difference between a left vs. right join, suppose you had a table of Facebook users and Facebook posts.

A LEFT JOIN retrieves all rows from the left table (in this case, the users table) and any matching rows from the right table (the posts table). If there is no match in the right table, NULL values will be returned for the right table's columns.

A RIGHT JOIN combines all rows from the right table (in this case, the posts table) and any matching rows from the left table (the users table). If there is no match in the left table, NULL values will be displayed for the left table's columns.

Left vs. Right Join

SQL Question 6: Facebook Friend Recommendations
Facebook wants to recommend new friends to people who show interest in attending 2 or more of the same private Facebook events.

Notes:

A user interested in attending would have either 'going' or 'maybe' as their attendance status.
Friend recommendations are unidirectional, meaning if user x and user y should be recommended to each other, the result table should have both user x recommended to user y and user y recommended to user x.
The result should not contain duplicates (i.e., user y should not be recommended to user x multiple times).
friendship_status Table:
Column Name	Type
user_a_id	integer
user_b_id	integer
status	enum ('friends', 'not_friends')
Each row of this table indicates the status of the friendship between user_a_id and user_b_id.

friendship_status Example Input:
user_a_id	user_b_id	status
111	333	not_friends
222	333	not_friends
333	222	not_friends
222	111	friends
111	222	friends
333	111	not_friends
event_rsvp Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
event_id	integer
event_type	enum ('public', 'private')
attendance_status	enum ('going', 'maybe', 'not_going')
event_date	date
event_rsvp Example Input:
user_id	event_id	event_type	attendance_status	event_date
111	567	public	going	07/12/2022
222	789	private	going	07/15/2022
333	789	private	maybe	07/15/2022
111	234	private	not_going	07/18/2022
222	234	private	going	07/18/2022
333	234	private	going	07/18/2022
Example Output:
user_a_id	user_b_id
222	333
333	222
Users 222 and 333 who are not friends have shown interest in attending 2 or more of the same private events.

Answer:
To find pairs of friends to be recommended to each other if they're interested in attending 2 or more of the same private events we'll:

Find users who are interested in attending private events.
Join tables to compare the correct data
Find pairs of users who are not friends but are interested in 2 or more of the same private events.
This leads to the following query:

WITH private_events AS (
SELECT user_id, event_id
FROM event_rsvp
WHERE attendance_status IN ('going', 'maybe')
  AND event_type = 'private'
)

SELECT 
  friends.user_a_id, 
  friends.user_b_id
FROM private_events AS events_1
INNER JOIN private_events AS events_2
  ON events_1.user_id != events_2.user_id
  AND events_1.event_id = events_2.event_id
INNER JOIN friendship_status AS friends
  ON events_1.user_id = friends.user_a_id
  AND events_2.user_id = friends.user_b_id
WHERE friends.status = 'not_friends'
GROUP BY friends.user_a_id, friends.user_b_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;

SQL QUESTION 7: Can you explain the concept of a constraint in SQL?
Constraints are just rules for your DBMS to follow when updating/inserting/deleting data.

Say you had a table of Facebook employees, and their salaries, job titles, and performance review data. Here's some examples of SQL constraints you could implement:

NOT NULL: This constraint could be used to ensure that certain columns in the employee table, such as the employee's first and last name, cannot contain NULL values.

UNIQUE: This constraint could be used to ensure that the employee ID is unique. This would prevent duplicate entries in the employee table.

PRIMARY KEY: This constraint could be used to combine the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints to create a primary key for the employee table. The employee ID could serve as the primary key.

FOREIGN KEY: This constraint could be used to establish relationships between the employee table and other tables in the database. For example, you could use a foreign key to link the employee ID to the department ID in a department table to track which department each employee belongs to.

CHECK: This constraint could be used to ensure that certain data meets specific conditions. For example, you could use a CHECK constraint to ensure that salary values are always positive numbers.

DEFAULT: This constraint could be used to specify default values for certain columns. For example, you could use a DEFAULT constraint to set the employee hire date to the current date if no value is provided when a new employee is added to the database.

SQL Question 8: Average Number of Shares per Post
As a data analyst at Facebook, you are asked to find the average number of shares per post for each user.

In the user_posts table, each row represents a post by a user. Each user may have zero or more posts.

In the post_shares table, each row represents a share of a post. Each post may have zero or more shares.

Please write a SQL query to find the average number of shares per post for each user.

user_posts Example Input:
post_id	user_id	post_text	post_date
1	1	Hello world!	06/08/2022 00:00:00
2	2	What a beautiful day!	06/10/2022 00:00:00
3	1	Hope everyone is having a good day!	06/18/2022 00:00:00
4	3	Facebook is amazing!	07/26/2022 00:00:00
5	2	Enjoying a great meal!	07/05/2022 00:00:00
post_shares Example Input:
share_id	post_id	share_date
1	1	06/09/2022 00:00:00
2	2	06/11/2022 00:00:00
3	1	06/19/2022 00:00:00
4	1	06/29/2022 00:00:00
5	3	07/27/2022 00:00:00
Example Output:
user_id	avg_shares_per_post
1	1.67
2	0.50
3	0.00
Answer:
SELECT 
    U.user_id,
    COALESCE(AVG(S.shares), 0) as avg_shares_per_post
FROM 
    user_posts as U
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT 
            post_id, 
            COUNT(share_id) as shares
        FROM 
            post_shares
        GROUP BY 
            post_id
        ) as S on U.post_id = S.post_id
GROUP BY 
    U.user_id;
This query works by first finding the total number of shares for each post by grouping on post_id in the post_shares table. Then, it joins this with user_posts on post_id to get the user_id of the user who made each post. It finally averages the total number of shares for each user using the AVG function. Null values are replaced with zero so that users who have no shares do not return null for avg_shares_per_post.

SQL Question 9: Calculate Facebook Ad Click-Through Rate
Assume you have an events table on Facebook app analytics. Write a SQL query to calculate the click-through rate (CTR) for the app in 2022 and round the results to 2 decimal places.

Definition and note:

Percentage of click-through rate (CTR) = 100.0 * Number of clicks / Number of impressions
To avoid integer division, multiply the CTR by 100.0, not 100.

events Table:
Column Name	Type
app_id	integer
event_type	string
timestamp	datetime
events Example Input:
app_id	event_type	timestamp
123	impression	07/18/2022 11:36:12
123	impression	07/18/2022 11:37:12
123	click	07/18/2022 11:37:42
234	impression	07/18/2022 14:15:12
234	click	07/18/2022 14:16:12
Example Output:
app_id	ctr
123	50.00
234	100.00
Answer:
We first find the number of clicks and impressions using the CASE statement to assign a value of 1 for 'click' events and 0 for other events.

Then, to calculate the percentage of click-through rate (CTR) we divide the number of clicks by the number of impressions and multiplying by 100.0, rounded to 2 decimal places using the ROUND() function.

This yields the following solution:

SELECT
  app_id,
  ROUND(100.0 *
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'click' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'impression' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2)  AS ctr_rate
FROM events
WHERE timestamp >= '2022-01-01' 
  AND timestamp < '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY app_id;
