A (somewhat opinionated) list of SQL tips and tricks that I've picked up over the years.

There's so much you can do with SQL but I've focused on what I find most useful in my day-to-day work as a data analyst and what I wish I had known when I first started writing SQL.

Please note that some of these tips might not be relevant for all RDBMSs.

Miscellaneous
Understand the order of execution
Read the documentation (in full)
Use descriptive names for your saved queries
Formatting/readability
Use a leading comma to separate fields
Use a leading comma to separate fields in the SELECT clause rather than a trailing comma.

Clearly defines that this is a new column vs code that's wrapped to multiple lines.

Visual cue to easily identify if the comma is missing or not. Varying line lengths makes it harder to determine.

SELECT
employee_id
, employee_name
, job
, salary
FROM employees
;
Also use a leading AND in the WHERE clause, for the same reasons (following tip demonstrates this).
Use a dummy value in the WHERE clause
Use a dummy value in the WHERE clause so you can easily comment out conditions when testing or tweaking a query.

/*
If I want to comment out the job
condition the following query
will break:
*/
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE
--job IN ('Clerk', 'Manager')
AND dept_no != 5
;

/*
With a dummy value there's no issue.
I can comment out all the conditions
and 1=1 will ensure the query still runs:
*/
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE 1=1
-- AND job IN ('Clerk', 'Manager')
AND dept_no != 5
;
Indent your code
Indent your code to make it more readable to colleagues and your future self.

Opinions will vary on what this looks like, so be sure to follow your company/team's guidelines or, if that doesn't exist, go with whatever works for you.

You can also use an online formatter like poorsql or a linter like sqlfluff.

SELECT
-- Bad:
vc.video_id
, CASE WHEN meta.GENRE IN ('Drama', 'Comedy') THEN 'Entertainment' ELSE meta.GENRE END as content_type
FROM video_content AS vc
INNER JOIN metadata ON vc.video_id = metadata.video_id
;

-- Good:
SELECT 
vc.video_id
, CASE 
	WHEN meta.GENRE IN ('Drama', 'Comedy') THEN 'Entertainment' 
	ELSE meta.GENRE 
END AS content_type
FROM video_content
INNER JOIN metadata 
	ON video_content.video_id = metadata.video_id
;
Consider CTEs when writing complex queries
For longer than I'd care to admit I would nest inline views, which would lead to queries that were hard to understand, particularly if revisited after a few weeks.

If you find yourself nesting inline views more than 2 or 3 levels deep, consider using common table expressions, which can help you keep your code more organised and readable.

-- Using inline views:
SELECT 
vhs.movie
, vhs.vhs_revenue
, cs.cinema_revenue
FROM 
    (
    SELECT
    movie_id
    , SUM(ticket_sales) AS cinema_revenue
    FROM tickets
    GROUP BY movie_id
    ) AS cs
    INNER JOIN 
        (
        SELECT 
        movie
        , movie_id
        , SUM(revenue) AS vhs_revenue
        FROM blockbuster
        GROUP BY movie, movie_id
        ) AS vhs
        ON cs.movie_id = vhs.movie_id
;

-- Using CTEs:
WITH cinema_sales AS 
    (
        SELECT 
        movie_id
        , SUM(ticket_sales) AS cinema_revenue
        FROM tickets
        GROUP BY movie_id
    ),
    vhs_sales AS
    (
        SELECT 
        movie
        , movie_id
        , SUM(revenue) AS vhs_revenue
        FROM blockbuster
        GROUP BY movie, movie_id
    )
SELECT 
vhs.movie
, vhs.vhs_revenue
, cs.cinema_revenue
FROM cinema_sales AS cs
    INNER JOIN vhs_sales AS vhs
    ON cs.movie_id = vhs.movie_id
;
Comment your code
While in the moment you know why you did something, if you revisit the code weeks, months or years later you might not remember.

In general you should strive to write comments that explain why you did something, not how.

Your colleagues and future self will thank you!

SELECT 
video_content.*
FROM video_content
    LEFT JOIN archive
    ON video_content.video_id = archive.video_id
WHERE 1=1
-- Need to filter out as new CMS cannot process archive video formats:
AND archive.video_id IS NULL
;
Simplify joins with USING
If you're joining using a column with the same name in two tables you can use USING to simplify your join:

-- USING:
SELECT * 
FROM album 
	INNER JOIN artist 
	USING (artistid)

-- Traditional ON clause:
SELECT * 
FROM album 
	INNER JOIN artist 
	ON album.artistid = artist.ArtistId 
The other benefit of USING is that the column in common between the two tables is deduplicated, with only one column returned in the result set.

This means that there is no ambiguity, unlike the following query which would throw a ambiguous column name error as the database would not be sure which column to which you are referring if you are using the ON clause:

SELECT ArtistId -- Which table column?
FROM album
	INNER JOIN artist 
	ON album.artistid = artist.ArtistId
Data wrangling
Anti-joins will return rows from one table that have no match in another table
Use anti-joins when you want to return rows from one table that don't have a match in another table.

For example, you only want video IDs of content that hasn't been archived.

There are multiple ways to do an anti-join:

-- Using a LEFT JOIN:
SELECT 
vc.video_id
FROM video_content AS vc
    LEFT JOIN archive
    ON vc.video_id = archive.video_id
WHERE 1=1
AND archive.video_id IS NULL -- Any rows with no match will have a NULL value.
;

-- Using NOT IN/subquery:
SELECT 
video_id
FROM video_content
WHERE 1=1
AND video_id NOT IN (SELECT video_id FROM archive) -- Be mindful of NULL values.

-- Using NOT EXISTS/correlated subquery:
SELECT 
video_id
FROM video_content AS vc
WHERE 1=1
AND NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM archive AS a
        WHERE a.video_id = vc.video_id
        )
Note that I advise against using NOT IN - see this tip.

Use QUALIFY to filter window functions
QUALIFY lets you filter the results of a query based on a window function, meaning you don't need to use an inline view to filter your result set and thus reducing the number of lines of code.

For example, if I want to return the top 10 markets per product I can use QUALIFY rather than an inline view:

-- Using QUALIFY:
SELECT 
product
, market
, SUM(revenue) AS market_revenue 
FROM sales
GROUP BY product, market
QUALIFY DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC)  <= 10
ORDER BY product, market_revenue
;

-- Without QUALIFY:
SELECT 
product
, market
, market_revenue 
FROM
(
SELECT 
product
, market
, SUM(revenue) AS market_revenue
, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC) AS market_rank
FROM sales
GROUP BY product, market
)
WHERE market_rank  <= 10
ORDER BY product, market_revenue
;
Unfortunately it looks like QUALIFY is only available in the big data warehouses (Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery) but I had to include this because it's so useful.

You can (but shouldn't always) GROUP BY column position
Instead of using the column name, you can GROUP BY or ORDER BY using the column position.

This can be useful for ad-hoc/one-off queries, but for production code you should always refer to a column by its name.
SELECT 
dept_no
, SUM(salary) AS dept_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY 1 -- dept_no is the first column in the SELECT clause.
ORDER BY 2 DESC
;
Create a grand total with GROUP BY ROLLUP
Creating a grand total (or sub-totals) is possible thanks to GROUP BY ROLLUP.

For example, if you've aggregated a company's employees salary per department you can use GROUP BY ROLLUP to create a grand total that sums up the aggregated dept_salary column.

SELECT 
COALESCE(dept_no, 'Total') AS dept_no
, SUM(salary) AS dept_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY ROLLUP(dept_no)
ORDER BY dept_salary -- Be sure to order by this column to ensure the Total appears last/at the bottom of the result set.
;
Use EXCEPT to find the difference between two tables
EXCEPT returns rows from the first query's result set that don't appear in the second query's result set.

/*
Miles Davis will be returned from
this query
*/
SELECT artist_name
FROM artist
WHERE artist_name = 'Miles Davis'
EXCEPT 
SELECT artist_name
FROM artist
WHERE artist_name = 'Nirvana'
;

/*
Nothing will be returned from this
query as 'Miles Davis' appears in
both queries' result sets.
*/
SELECT artist_name
FROM artist
WHERE artist_name = 'Miles Davis'
EXCEPT 
SELECT artist_name
FROM artist
WHERE artist_name = 'Miles Davis'
;
You can also utilise EXCEPT with UNION ALL to verify whether two tables have the same data.

If no rows are returned the tables are identical - otherwise, what's returned are the rows causing the difference:

/* 
The first query will return rows from
employees that aren't present in
department.

The second query will return rows from
department that aren't present in employees.

The UNION ALL will ensure that the
final result set returned combines
all of these rows so you know
which rows are causing the difference.
*/
(
SELECT 
id
, employee_name
FROM employees
EXCEPT 
SELECT 
id
, employee_name
FROM department
)
UNION ALL 
(
SELECT 
id
, employee_name
FROM department
EXCEPT
SELECT 
id
, employee_name
FROM employees
)
;
Performance
NOT EXISTS is faster than NOT IN if your column allows NULL
NOT IN is usually slower than using NOT EXISTS, if the values/column you're comparing against allows NULL.

I've experienced this when using Snowflake and the PostgreSQL Wiki explicitly calls this out:

"...NOT IN (SELECT ...) does not optimize very well."

Aside from being slow, using NOT IN will not work as intended if there is a NULL in the values being compared against - see tip 11.

Why include this tip if NOT IN doesn't work with NULL values anyway?

Well just because a column allows NULL values does not mean there are any NULL values present and if you're working with a table that you cannot alter you'll want to use NOT EXISTS to speed up your query.

Implicit casting will slow down (or break) your query
If you specify a value with a different data type than a column's, your database may automatically (implicitly) convert the value.

For example, let's say the video_id column has a string data type and you specify an integer in the WHERE clause:

SELECT video_name
FROM video_content 
 -- Behind the scenes the database will implicitly attempt to convert the video_id column to an integer:
WHERE video_id = 200050
There's a couple of problems with relying on implicit casting:

An error may be thrown if the implicit conversion isn't possible - for example, if one of the video IDs has a string value of 'abc2000'

*Your query may be slower, due to the additional work of converting each value to the specified data type.

Instead, use the same data type as the column you're operating on (WHERE video_ID = '200050') or, to avoid errors, use a function like TRY_TO_NUMBER that will attempt the conversion but handle any errors:

SELECT video_name
FROM video_content 
 -- This won't result in an error:
WHERE TRY_TO_NUMBER(video_id) = 200050
* Note that this depends on the size of the dataset being operated on.

Common mistakes
Be aware of how NOT IN behaves with NULL values
NOT IN doesn't work if NULL is present in the values being checked against. As NULL represents Unknown the SQL engine can't verify that the value being checked is not present in the list.

Instead use NOT EXISTS.
INSERT INTO departments (id)
VALUES (1), (2), (NULL);

-- Doesn't work due to NULL:
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE department_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT id from departments)
;

-- Solution.
SELECT * 
FROM employees e
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM departments d 
    WHERE d.id = e.department_id
)
;
Avoid ambiguity when naming calculated fields
When creating a calculated field, naming it the same as an existing column can lead to unexpected behaviour.

Note Snowflake's documentation on the topic:

"If a GROUP BY clause contains a name that matches both a column name and an alias, then the GROUP BY clause uses the column name."

For example you might expect the following to return 2 rows but what's actually returned is 3 rows:

CREATE TABLE products (
    product VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    revenue INT NOT NULL
)
;

INSERT INTO products (product, revenue)
VALUES 
    ('Shark', 100),
    ('Robot', 150),
    ('Racecar', 90);

SELECT 
LEFT(product, 1) AS product -- Returns the first letter of the product value.
, MAX(revenue) as max_revenue
FROM products
GROUP BY product
;
PRODUCT	MAX_REVENUE
S	100
R	150
R	90
What's happened is that the LEFT function has been applied after the product column has been grouped and aggregation applied.

The solution is to use a unique alias or be more explicit in the GROUP BY clause:

-- Solution option 1:
SELECT 
LEFT(product, 1) AS product_letter
, MAX(revenue) AS max_revenue
FROM products
GROUP BY product_letter
;

-- Solution option 2:
SELECT 
LEFT(product, 1) AS product,
, MAX(revenue) AS max_revenue
FROM products
GROUP BY LEFT(product, 1)
;
Result:

PRODUCT_LETTER	MAX_REVENUE
S	100
R	150
Assigning an alias to a calculated field can also be problematic when it comes to window functions.

In this example the CASE statement is being applied AFTER the window function has executed:

/*
The window function will rank the 'Robot' product as 1 when it should be 3.
*/
SELECT 
product
, CASE product WHEN 'Robot' THEN 0 ELSE revenue END AS revenue
, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC)
FROM products
;
Our earlier solutions apply:

/*
Solution option 1 (note this might not work in all RDBMS, in which case use the other solution):
*/
SELECT 
product
, CASE product WHEN 'Robot' THEN 0 ELSE revenue END AS updated_revenue
, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY updated_revenue DESC)
FROM products
;

-- Solution option 2:
SELECT 
product
, CASE product WHEN 'Robot' THEN 0 ELSE revenue END AS revenue
, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY CASE product WHEN 'Robot' THEN 0 ELSE revenue END DESC)
FROM products
;
My advice - use a unique alias when possible to avoid confusion.

Always specify which column belongs to which table
When you have complex queries with multiple joins, it pays to be able to trace back an issue with a value to its source.

Additionally, your RDBMS might raise an error if two tables share the same column name and you don't specify which column you are using.

SELECT 
vc.video_id
, vc.series_name
, metadata.season
, metadata.episode_number
FROM video_content AS vc 
    INNER JOIN video_metadata AS metadata
    ON vc.video_id = metadata.video_id
;
Miscellaneous
Understand the order of execution
If I had to give one piece of advice to someone learning SQL, it'd be to understand the order of execution (of clauses). It will completely change how you write queries. This blog post is a fantastic resource for learning.

Read the documentation (in full)
Using Snowflake I once needed to return the latest date from a list of columns and so I decided to use GREATEST().

What I didn't realise was that if one of the arguments is NULL then the function returns NULL.

If I'd read the documentation in full I'd have known! In many cases it can take just a minute or less to scan the documentation and it will save you the headache of having to work out why something isn't working the way you expected:

/*
If I'd read the documentation
further I'd also have realised
that my solution to the NULL
problem with GREATEST()... 
*/

SELECT COALESCE(GREATEST(signup_date, consumption_date), signup_date, consumption_date);

/*
... could have been solved with the
following function:
*/
SELECT GREATEST_IGNORE_NULLS(signup_date, consumption_date);
Use descriptive names for your saved queries
There's almost nothing worse than not being able to find a query you need to re-run/refer back to.

Use a descriptive name when saving your queries so you can easily find what you're looking for.

I usually will write the subject of the query, the month the query was ran and the name of the requester (if they exist). For example: Lapsed users analysis - 2023-09-01 - Olivia Roberts
