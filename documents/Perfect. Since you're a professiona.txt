Would you like this exported to a Google Sheet (e.g., by pillar/category) or converted into a printable PDF/Notion-ready doc?

Also, I can generate **visual diagrams** of:

* Funnel metrics flow
* Attribution model comparisons
* Analytics stack architecture

Let me know what you'd like next.

Absolutely. Here’s a **text-based version** of the three visual diagrams I originally proposed, presented cleanly and professionally so you can use them in documentation or presentations:

---

## ✅ 1. Funnel Metrics & Conversions – Text Diagram

```plaintext
Funnel Stage         | Example Metrics
---------------------|---------------------------------------------------
AWARENESS            | Impressions, Reach, CPM (Cost per Thousand Imps)
ENGAGEMENT           | Clicks, CTR (Click-Through Rate), Bounce Rate
CONVERSION           | Conversions, Conversion Rate, CVR, CPA (Cost/Action)
LEADS                | MQLs (Marketing Qualified Leads), Lead Score
OPPORTUNITIES        | SQLs (Sales Qualified Leads), Opportunity Rate
REVENUE              | Revenue, Revenue per Conversion, LTV (Lifetime Value)
```

This framework connects media and content performance to business impact. It’s often used for:

* Performance marketing dashboards
* Funnel diagnosis
* CAC modeling

## ✅ 2. Attribution Models Comparison – Text Table

```plaintext
Model Type               | Description
-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
Last-Click               | Gives 100% credit to the final interaction before conversion
First-Click              | Assigns full credit to the initial touchpoint
Linear                   | Equal credit to all touchpoints in the customer journey
Time-Decay               | More credit to recent touchpoints; less to earlier ones
U-Shaped (Position-Based)| Heavy weight to first and last interactions; light in between
Data-Driven (DDA)        | Uses ML to assign fractional credit based on observed outcomes
Shapley / Markov Chain   | Advanced probabilistic models, better for MTA but complex to scale
Incrementality-Based     | Measures actual causal impact via tests (e.g., geo-lift, holdouts)
```

Use Cases:

* **Media mix performance comparison**
* **Channel contribution to conversion**
* **Budget reallocation planning**

## ✅ 3. Marketing Analytics Stack Architecture – Text Layout

```plaintext
Layer             | Example Tools / Responsibilities
------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Tracking Layer | Google Tag Manager, Segment, Tealium, SDKs (iOS/Android), Meta Pixel
2. Raw Data Layer | GA4, Amplitude, Mixpanel, Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Salesforce
3. ETL Layer      | Fivetran, Airbyte, dbt, Python pipelines, BigQuery scripts
4. Warehouse      | Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks

7. Activation     | Reverse ETL (Hightouch, Census), CRM targeting, audience syncing
8. Governance     | Metric definitions, tracking plans, naming conventions, QA systems
```

This architecture supports end-to-end:

* Self-serve dashboards

Would you like a **Google Sheets or Notion table** version of any of these? I can also combine them into a **PDF one-pager** or expand each into implementation templates (e.g., “how to set up a funnel metrics dashboard in Looker”).
