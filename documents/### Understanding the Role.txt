### Understanding the Role 
Based on the job description, this Senior Manager position in Advanced Analytics for Marketing 
at Airbnb involves leading a team of analysts to drive data-informed decisions in growth 
marketing and product strategy. You'll focus on advanced analysis, experimentation (including 
causal inference), building metrics and tools, and collaborating cross-functionally with teams 
like Data Science and Finance. It's remote-eligible in the US (with some restrictions on states), 
requires 12+ years in analytics/data science and 8+ in management, and prefers experience in 
marketplaces, statistical modeling, and tools like LLMs. Strong communication and stakeholder 
management are emphasized. 
To prepare effectively, I'll break this down into targeted sections: SQL technical prep, case 
study prep for product metrics, general interview tips, and additional resources. Since the 
interview simulates a real work environment (e.g., allowing syntax lookups), focus on 
conceptual understanding, problem-solving logic, and applying concepts to Airbnb-like 
scenarios (e.g., bookings, hosts, guests, marketing campaigns). 
### SQL Preparation 
The technical portion will cover basic to intermediate SQL, using dialects like Hive or Presto 
(which are similar to standard SQL but optimized for big data). Key concepts include: - **Joins**: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS; handling multiple tables. - **Aggregating**: GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX/MIN; with HAVING for 
post-aggregation filters. - **Filtering**: WHERE clauses, conditional logic (CASE, IF). - **Subqueries**: Nested queries for filtering or aggregation. - **Self-joins**: Joining a table to itself, e.g., for hierarchical or time-based comparisons. - **Window functions**: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG/LEAD, PARTITION BY for analytics over 
partitions. 
Practice by writing queries on hypothetical Airbnb datasets. Assume tables like: - `users` (user_id, signup_date, country) - `listings` (listing_id, host_id, city, price) - `bookings` (booking_id, guest_id, listing_id, booking_date, checkin_date, nights, revenue) - `campaigns` (campaign_id, user_id, exposure_date, type)  // For marketing exposure 
#### Practice Questions 
I'll provide 10 questions progressing from basic to intermediate, with Airbnb-themed contexts. 
Try solving them first, then check the solutions. Use online SQL sandboxes (e.g., DB-Fiddle) or 
tools like ChatGPT for syntax checks during practice. 
1. **Basic Filtering and Aggregation**: Find the total revenue from bookings in San Francisco in 
2024. - Solution: `SELECT SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue FROM bookings JOIN listings ON 
bookings.listing_id = listings.listing_id WHERE listings.city = 'San Francisco' AND 
YEAR(booking_date) = 2024;` 
2. **Joins**: List all users who have hosted at least one listing but never made a booking as a 
guest. - Solution: `SELECT u.user_id, u.signup_date FROM users u JOIN listings l ON u.user_id = 
l.host_id LEFT JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.guest_id WHERE b.booking_id IS NULL 
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.signup_date HAVING COUNT(l.listing_id) >= 1;` 
3. **Subqueries**: Find listings with prices above the average price in their city. - Solution: `SELECT listing_id, city, price FROM listings WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) 
FROM listings AS sub WHERE sub.city = listings.city);` 
4. **Self-Joins**: Identify pairs of bookings by the same guest that occurred within 7 days of 
each other (e.g., for repeat travel patterns). - Solution: `SELECT b1.booking_id, b1.guest_id, b1.booking_date, b2.booking_id, 
b2.booking_date FROM bookings b1 JOIN bookings b2 ON b1.guest_id = b2.guest_id AND 
b1.booking_id < b2.booking_id WHERE DATEDIFF(b2.booking_date, b1.booking_date) <= 7;` 
5. **Window Functions (Basic)**: Rank listings by revenue within each city, showing the top 3 
per city. - Solution: `SELECT listing_id, city, revenue, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY 
revenue DESC) AS rank FROM (SELECT l.listing_id, l.city, SUM(b.revenue) AS revenue FROM 
listings l JOIN bookings b ON l.listing_id = b.listing_id GROUP BY l.listing_id, l.city) AS sub 
WHERE rank <= 3;` 
6. **Aggregating with Conditions**: Calculate the average nights stayed per booking, but only 
for users exposed to a 'discount' marketing campaign. - Solution: `SELECT AVG(nights) AS avg_nights FROM bookings b JOIN campaigns c ON 
b.guest_id = c.user_id WHERE c.type = 'discount';` 
7. **Subqueries in Joins**: Find the percentage of users who booked within 30 days of signup. - Solution: `SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT b.guest_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT u.user_id)) 
AS conversion_rate FROM users u LEFT JOIN bookings b ON u.user_id = b.guest_id AND 
DATEDIFF(b.booking_date, u.signup_date) <= 30;` 
8. **Window Functions (Advanced)**: For each booking, calculate the running total revenue 
per host over time. - Solution: `SELECT host_id, booking_date, revenue, SUM(revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY 
host_id ORDER BY booking_date) AS running_total FROM bookings b JOIN listings l ON 
b.listing_id = l.listing_id ORDER BY host_id, booking_date;` 
9. **Self-Joins with Aggregation**: Compare monthly booking growth year-over-year for each 
city. - Solution: `SELECT curr.city, curr.month, curr.bookings, prev.bookings AS prev_bookings, 
(curr.bookings - prev.bookings) * 100.0 / prev.bookings AS growth_pct FROM (SELECT l.city, 
DATE_TRUNC('month', b.booking_date) AS month, COUNT(b.booking_id) AS bookings FROM 
bookings b JOIN listings l ON b.listing_id = l.listing_id GROUP BY l.city, month) curr LEFT JOIN 
(SELECT l.city, DATE_TRUNC('month', b.booking_date) AS month, COUNT(b.booking_id) AS 
bookings FROM bookings b JOIN listings l ON b.listing_id = l.listing_id GROUP BY l.city, month) 
prev ON curr.city = prev.city AND DATE_ADD(curr.month, INTERVAL -1 YEAR) = prev.month;` 
10. **Combined Concepts**: Using window functions and subqueries, find the top 5% of hosts 
by revenue contribution in the last year, with their share of total revenue. - Solution: `WITH host_revenue AS (SELECT host_id, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue 
FROM bookings b JOIN listings l ON b.listing_id = l.listing_id WHERE YEAR(b.booking_date) = 
2024 GROUP BY host_id), ranked_hosts AS (SELECT host_id, total_revenue, NTILE(20) OVER 
(ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) AS percentile FROM host_revenue) SELECT host_id, 
total_revenue, (total_revenue / (SELECT SUM(total_revenue) FROM host_revenue)) * 100 AS 
revenue_share FROM ranked_hosts WHERE percentile = 1;` 
Tips for SQL Portion: - Practice explaining your query logic aloud—interviewers may ask why you chose a subquery 
over a join. - Handle edge cases: NULLs (use COALESCE), date functions (DATEADD, DATEDIFF), string 
manipulation (CONCAT, SUBSTRING). - If stuck, verbalize: "I'd look up the Presto syntax for window functions here." - Resources: LeetCode SQL problems (filter by medium), HackerRank, or Airbnb-specific mocks 
on Glassdoor. 
### Case Study Preparation 
The case study will assess your high-level approach to measuring product development and 
solving metrics problems. Expect scenarios like evaluating a new feature's impact or optimizing 
marketing spend. Structure your responses using a framework like: 
1. **Clarify the Problem**: Ask questions to define scope (e.g., "What are the success 
criteria?"). 
2. **Define Key Metrics**: North Star (e.g., bookings), proxies (e.g., engagement), guards (e.g., 
churn). 
3. **Analytical Approach**: Data sources, methods (A/B tests, causal inference), tools (SQL for 
querying, Python/R for modeling). 
4. **Dig Deeper**: Segment analysis, potential biases, next steps. 
5. **Recommendations**: Actionable insights, risks. 
#### Sample Case Studies 
Practice these with timed responses (20-30 mins), then discuss trade-offs. 
1. **Measuring a New Feature**: "Airbnb launches a 'personalized recommendations' feature 
for guests. How would you measure its success?" - Approach: North Star: Increase in booking conversion rate. Proxies: Click-through rate on 
recs, session time. Guards: No drop in host satisfaction. Method: A/B test (randomize users), 
SQL to query pre/post data, causal inference if rollout isn't clean (e.g., 
difference-in-differences). Dig deeper: Segment by user type (new vs. repeat), check for 
novelty effects. Recommendation: If uplift >5%, scale; else, iterate on algo. 
2. **Marketing Campaign Analysis**: "Evaluate the ROI of a email campaign targeting inactive 
hosts to relist properties." - Approach: Metrics: Incremental listings/reactivations, revenue lift, cost per acquisition. 
Approach: Control group (non-exposed hosts), propensity score matching for causal impact. 
SQL: Join campaigns and listings tables, aggregate reactivations post-exposure. Dig deeper: 
Cohort analysis by host tenure, attribution (first-touch vs. multi-touch). Recommendation: 
Calculate ROI as (incremental revenue - campaign cost) / cost; optimize by segmenting 
high-value hosts. 
3. **Product Metrics Problem**: "Bookings are down 10% YoY. How do you diagnose and 
propose fixes?" - Approach: Funnel breakdown: Traffic > Searches > Views > Bookings. Metrics: Drop-off 
rates at each stage. Approach: SQL cohort analysis, window functions for trends. Dig deeper: 
External factors (seasonality, competition via web data), internal (feature changes). 
Recommendation: If issue is in search-to-view, A/B test UI improvements; prioritize based on 
impact size. 
Tips for Case Study: - Tie to Airbnb's marketplace: Balance guest/host sides, consider network effects. - Mention advanced methods from JD: Causal inference (e.g., for non-random experiments), 
statistical modeling. - Practice with real data: Use public datasets like Inside Airbnb for mock analysis. 
### General Interview Tips - **Behavioral/Management**: Prepare stories on leading teams (e.g., developing analysts, 
handling conflicts), stakeholder influence, and driving impact (STAR method: Situation, Task, 
Action, Result). - **Airbnb-Specific**: Research recent news (e.g., AI integrations, post-pandemic recovery). 
Know core values: Champion the mission, be a host. - **Mock Interviews**: Use Pramp or Interviewing.io for practice. Record yourself for clarity. - **Tools/Resources**:  - Books: "Lean Analytics" for metrics, "SQL for Data Analysis" by Cathy Tanimura. 
- Online: Coursera's Google Data Analytics, Airbnb's Data University blog posts. - Search for experiences: Look up "Airbnb analytics interview" on Reddit/Glassdoor for 
patterns. - **Mindset**: Stay calm, think aloud, ask clarifying questions. Since it's senior, emphasize 
strategy over tactical execution. 
This should give you a strong foundation—focus on 2-3 hours daily on SQL practice and case 
walkthroughs. If you share more details (e.g., your background), I can refine this further!
