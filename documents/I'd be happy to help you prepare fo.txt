I'd be happy to help you prepare for the product metrics case study portion! Let me create a structured framework and some practice scenarios that mirror what you might encounter.

# **Structured Analytical Approach Framework**

When tackling product metric problems at Airbnb, use this framework:

## **1. CLARIFY THE PROBLEM**
- Understand the business objective
- Define the scope (geography, time period, user segment)
- Identify stakeholders and their goals

## **2. DEFINE SUCCESS METRICS**
- **Primary metric**: The main KPI you're trying to move
- **Secondary metrics**: Supporting indicators
- **Guardrail metrics**: Things you don't want to negatively impact
- **Counter metrics**: Potential negative side effects

## **3. STRUCTURE YOUR ANALYSIS**
- Break down the metric into components (use funnels, formulas)
- Identify where the issue/opportunity lies
- Form hypotheses about root causes

## **4. RECOMMEND APPROACH**
- What data you'd need
- What analyses you'd run
- How you'd validate findings

# **Practice Case Studies**

Let me give you three realistic scenarios:

## **Case Study 1: Booking Conversion Drop**

**Scenario:** "Over the past 2 weeks, we've seen a 15% decline in booking conversion rate (bookings/searches). How would you approach investigating this?"

**Try answering this yourself first, then expand below for my approach:**

<details>
<summary>Click to see structured approach</summary>

**1. Clarify:**
- Time period: Last 2 weeks vs. what baseline?
- Geography: Global or specific markets?
- Platform: Web, iOS, Android, or all?
- User segment: New vs. returning guests?

**2. Define Metrics:**
- Primary: Booking Conversion Rate = Bookings / Searches
- Secondary: Search-to-inquiry rate, inquiry-to-booking rate, average search results shown
- Guardrail: Revenue per booking, guest satisfaction
- Counter: Host acceptance rate (could decline if we're showing worse inventory)

**3. Break Down the Funnel:**
```
Search → View Listings → Click on Listing → View Details → 
Message Host / Inquire → Request to Book → Booking Confirmed
```

**Hypothesis Areas:**
- **Supply**: Fewer available listings? Price increases? Lower quality inventory shown?
- **Demand**: Seasonal change? Marketing channel mix shift? User intent change?
- **Product**: Recent feature changes? A/B tests running? Search algorithm changes?
- **Technical**: Page load times? Mobile app bugs? Payment issues?
- **External**: Competitor activity? Economic factors? Travel restrictions?

**4. Analysis Approach:**
- **Segmentation analysis**: Break down by device, geography, new vs. returning, price tier
- **Cohort analysis**: Is this affecting all cohorts or just recent users?
- **Funnel analysis**: Which step in the funnel is dropping?
- **Time series**: Did it drop suddenly or gradually?
- **A/B test check**: Any recent experiments that went live?

## **Case Study 2: New Feature Impact**

**Scenario:** "Airbnb is considering launching a 'Flexible Dates' feature that shows guests alternative dates with better pricing. How would you design an experiment and what metrics would you track?"

**Your turn - structure your approach, then see mine below:**

<details>
<summary>Click to see structured approach</summary>

**1. Clarify:**
- Who sees this feature? (All users or specific segments?)
- Where in the booking flow?
- What's the business goal? (Increase bookings? Improve occupancy rates? Increase guest satisfaction?)

**2. Define Metrics:**

**Primary Metrics:**
- Booking conversion rate
- Bookings per user
- Gross Booking Value (GBV)

**Secondary Metrics:**
- Feature engagement rate (% who interact with flexible dates)
- Search-to-booking time
- Number of searches per session
- Alternative date click-through rate

**Guardrail Metrics:**
- Revenue per booking (ensure we're not just driving cheaper bookings)
- Host earnings
- Guest satisfaction (NPS/CSAT)
- Cancellation rate

**Counter Metrics:**
- Original date abandonment rate
- Lower ADR (Average Daily Rate) if users only book cheaper dates

**3. Experiment Design:**

**Test Setup:**
- Control: Standard search experience
- Treatment: Flexible dates feature
- Sample size: Calculate based on expected effect size
- Duration: 2-4 weeks to account for weekly seasonality
- Randomization: User-level (to avoid spillover effects)

**Segmentation to Analyze:**
- New vs. returning guests
- Flexible travelers vs. date-constrained (infer from search behavior)
- Trip length
- Destination type (urban vs. beach vs. mountain)
- Lead time (how far in advance they're booking)

**4. Analysis Plan:**

**Week 1:** Monitor for technical issues and sample ratio mismatch

**During Experiment:**
- Daily metric monitoring
- Engagement tracking (who's using the feature?)
- Funnel impact analysis

**Post-Experiment:**
- Statistical significance testing
- Heterogeneous treatment effects (does it work better for certain segments?)
- Long-term impact assessment (do users return more? do they book multiple trips?)
- Host impact analysis

**Decision Framework:**
- Ship if: Significant increase in bookings AND no negative impact on revenue/host earnings
- Iterate if: High engagement but mixed results on bookings
- Kill if: No engagement or negative impact on key metrics

## **Case Study 3: Two-Sided Marketplace Challenge**

**Scenario:** "Host sign-ups have increased 30% quarter-over-quarter, but guest bookings have only grown 10%. What problems could this create, and how would you investigate?"

**Structure your approach:**

<details>
<summary>Click to see structured approach</summary>

**1. Clarify the Problem:**
This is a **supply-demand imbalance** - classic two-sided marketplace challenge.

**Potential Issues:**
- Lower host occupancy rates → frustrated hosts → churn
- Pricing pressure (more supply = lower prices?)
- Quality dilution if we're accepting lower-quality hosts
- Search experience degradation (too many results?)

**2. Key Metrics to Track:**

**Host Side:**
- Host occupancy rate (% of available nights booked)
- Host earnings per month
- Time to first booking
- Host retention/churn rate
- Host satisfaction scores

**Guest Side:**
- Search results returned per query
- Booking conversion rate
- Guest satisfaction with listings

**Marketplace Health:**
- Supply utilization rate
- Take rate (Airbnb's revenue %)
- Market concentration (are bookings concentrated among top hosts?)

**3. Investigative Questions:**

**Geographic Analysis:**
- Is the imbalance uniform across markets?
- Are new hosts in areas with existing high demand or oversupplied markets?

**Host Quality:**
- What's the quality distribution of new hosts?
- Are they competitive on price/amenities?
- Photo quality, descriptions, response rates?

**Guest Demand:**
- Has guest search volume increased?
- Are guests finding what they're looking for?
- Has time-to-book changed?

**Segment Analysis:**
- What types of properties are new hosts adding?
- Is it matching guest search patterns?

**4. Analytical Approach:**

```sql
-- Example analysis structure
-- Host utilization by cohort
SELECT 
    host_signup_month,
    AVG(nights_booked / nights_available) as occupancy_rate,
    AVG(days_to_first_booking) as time_to_first_booking,
    COUNT(DISTINCT host_id) as num_hosts
FROM host_metrics
WHERE signup_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

-- Supply-demand balance by market
SELECT 
    market_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT listing_id) as total_listings,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN booked = 1 THEN listing_id END) / 
        COUNT(DISTINCT listing_id) as utilization_rate,
    SUM(search_volume) as total_searches
FROM market_metrics
GROUP BY 1
HAVING utilization_rate < 0.5 -- Flag oversupplied markets
```

**5. Recommendations:**

**Short-term:**
- Pause host acquisition in oversupplied markets
- Improve search ranking for new hosts (cold-start problem)
- Dynamic pricing recommendations for new hosts

**Medium-term:**
- Focus guest acquisition in undersupplied markets
- Host quality scoring and selective acceptance
- Better host onboarding (photos, pricing, calendars)

**Long-term:**
- Predictive model: Match host acquisition to demand forecasts
- Market-by-market growth strategies
- Product features to improve utilization (flexible search, last-minute bookings)

# **Key Tips for Your Interview**

1. **Always start with clarifying questions** - shows you think before diving in
2. **Think out loud** - interviewers want to see your thought process
3. **Use frameworks** - funnels, formulas, segmentation
4. **Consider trade-offs** - every metric change has potential downsides
5. **Be hypothesis-driven** - "I would check if..." not "The problem is..."
6. **Think about the two-sided marketplace** - Airbnb is about hosts AND guests
7. **Mention data validation** - seasonality, external factors, data quality
8. **Connect to business impact** - not just "metric went up" but "this means $X revenue"

Would you like me to create more practice cases, or would you like to work through one of these together in real-time where I ask follow-up questions like an interviewer would?
