Competency
Skill Level & Key Concepts
Core Tools
Application in a Project (Use Case)
SQL
Foundational: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, INNER/LEFT JOINs. <br> Advanced: Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, LEAD), Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Subqueries, performance tuning.
PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, BigQuery, Redshift
Extracting, segmenting, and aggregating customer subscription and product usage data from the company's main database.
Spreadsheets
Foundational: VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, Pivot Tables, data filters. <br> Advanced: Power Query (Get & Transform), creating data models, complex nested formulas.
Excel, Google Sheets
Performing quick, ad-hoc analysis on a smaller data export; validating data quality; creating simple charts for a team meeting.
Python
Foundational: Data structures, functions, loops, using Jupyter Notebooks.
 Advanced: Mastery of key libraries:
 • Pandas: DataFrames for cleaning, transforming, merging, & grouping.
 • NumPy: Numerical operations.
 • Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.
 • Scikit-learn: Building predictive models (e.g., regression).
 • Statsmodels: Rigorous statistical testing.
Jupyter, VS Code, Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Writing a script to clean a 500k-row dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, and build a logistic regression model to predict customer churn.
BI Platforms
Foundational: Connecting to data sources (CSVs, databases), building standard charts (bar, line, scatter).
 Advanced: Creating interactive dashboards with filters and actions, using calculated fields, data storytelling.
Tableau, Power BI, Looker Studio
Creating a C-level interactive dashboard that reports on key churn drivers and allows stakeholders to drill down into specific customer segments.
Statistics
Foundational: Descriptive Statistics (mean, median, standard deviation), basic probability.
 Advanced: Inferential Statistics (Hypothesis/A/B testing, t-tests), Regression Analysis (Linear, Logistic).
Python (Statsmodels, Scikit-learn), Excel
Designing and analyzing an A/B test to determine if a new app feature significantly reduced customer churn compared to the old version.
