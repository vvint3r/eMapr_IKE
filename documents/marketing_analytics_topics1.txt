# Marketing Analytics: Comprehensive Topic‑Based Hierarchical Taxonomy

## Introduction to the Taxonomy Approach

As a marketing analytics expert with deep knowledge across product, business,  
and statistics, I originally developed this extensive hierarchical taxonomy  
to serve as a complete learning path through the marketing analytics field.  
This taxonomy is structured to progress from broad foundational concepts down  
to highly specific, actionable topics—covering areas that other frameworks  
often miss.

To make the framework even more comprehensive, this revision incorporates  
additional domains that reflect emerging practices such as customer‑experience  
measurement, augmented analytics, data clean rooms, sustainability metrics,  
marketing operations and growth analytics, creative performance analysis and  
other specialized areas. Where appropriate, citations are provided to  
highlight why these additions are important. For example, augmented  
analytics platforms can automatically surface critical insights and optimize  
budgets[adverity.com](https://www.adverity.com/augmented-analytics#:~:text=technology%20in%20modern%20businesses%3A%20%E2%80%9CAugmented,technologies%20based%20on%20artificial%20intelligence), data clean rooms provide a privacy‑safe  
environment for analyzing combined datasets, and  
customer‑experience metrics such as Net‑Promoter Score and Customer  
Satisfaction Score help gauge loyalty and friction points.

The structure follows a logical progression through five primary levels:

- Level 1: Core Domains – The fundamental pillars of marketing analytics.   
- Level 2: Major Categories – Key subdisciplines within each domain.  
- Level 3: Specialized Areas – Specific methodologies and applications. 
- Level 4: Technical Components – Tools, techniques, and frameworks.  
- Level 5: Granular Topics – Highly specific implementation details.

This taxonomy is designed to be comprehensive enough to guide professionals  
from foundational understanding through advanced implementation while  
remaining practical for real‑world application.

## Level 1: Core Domains of Marketing Analytics

### 1. Foundational Analytics & Measurement

Purpose: Establishing the fundamental principles, frameworks, and  
methodologies that underpin all marketing analytics work.

#### Level 2 Categories:

##### 1.1 Analytics Frameworks & Methodologies

- Descriptive Analytics – Understanding what happened.  
- Diagnostic Analytics – Understanding why it happened.  
- Predictive Analytics – Forecasting what will happen.  
- Prescriptive Analytics – Recommending what should happen.  
- Real‑time Analytics – Immediate insights and monitoring.  

##### 1.2 Data Management & Infrastructure

- Data Collection & Integration – Capturing data from first‑party,  
    second‑party and third‑party sources; web tracking and tagging  
    implementation; server‑side tracking; API integrations.  
- Data Quality & Governance – Data validation and cleansing;  
    privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA); data ethics and responsible use;  
    master data management; data lineage and audit trails.  
- Data Architecture – Data warehouses, data lakes, cloud  
    platforms, ETL/ELT processes and real‑time data streaming.  
- Data Clean Rooms & Secure Data Collaboration – Emerging  
    privacy‑preserving environments where multiple parties can analyse  
    combined datasets without sharing the underlying information. A  
    data clean room creates a secure space for data ingestion, privacy  
    enforcement, computation and aggregated output; parties upload their  
    own data into the environment, and privacy‑enhancing technologies  
    ensure that no party can see another’s raw data.  
    Analysis is performed on anonymised or securely computed data and  
    only aggregated insights leave the clean room.  
    Use cases include cross‑publisher ad measurement, joint  
    research collaborations and partner‑level audience insights.  
- Data Quality & Observability – Monitoring data freshness,  
    completeness and accuracy; implementing data quality scoring,  
    anomaly detection and DataOps practices to ensure reliable inputs  
    for analytics. Includes metadata management, data cataloguing and  
    lineage tracking.  
- Consent & Identity Management – Managing user consent for data  
    collection, preference centres, deterministic and probabilistic  
    identity resolution, and customer identity and access management.  

##### 1.3 Statistical Foundations

- Probability & Distributions  
- Hypothesis Testing  
- Regression Analysis – Simple linear, multiple regression,  
    logistic regression, time series regression.  
- Correlation & Causation  
- Sampling Methods  
- Statistical Significance & P‑values  
- Confidence Intervals

    sustainability data—covering energy use, waste, emissions and  
    other environmental impacts—is essential to their long‑term  
    health and profitability. Tracking  
    sustainability metrics allows companies to identify risks and  
    hidden costs, proactively develop sustainability programmes and  
    position themselves for strategic growth.

    devices) to enable real‑time decision‑making and reduce latency.  
      
    
- Federated Learning: Collaborative model training across  
    distributed devices or partners without centralising data,  
    enhancing privacy and compliance. Applicable to personalised  
    recommendation and predictive models in marketing.
